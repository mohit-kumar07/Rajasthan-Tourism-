        <div class="textmoti">
            <p>Rani Ji Ki Stepwell, known by the tourists as 'Queen of Stepwell', was built in 1699 by Nathavati Ji, the younger queen of Bundi ruler Rao Raja Anirudh Singh Ji. The main entrance of this stepwell looks inviting. An exquisitely carved statue of an elephant is installed on the archway of the multi-storey stepwell, in which its trunk is turned inwards, giving the impression as if the elephant is drinking water from the stepwell.</p>

       <p>While climbing a steep slope to reach the Garh Palace, Bundi, we reach two main gates, which are the entrances to the Garh Palace. 'Hathi Pol' is the most famous of these two gates. The grand and huge (Hathi Pol) is a unique example of architecture and architecture, seeing which the mind gets overwhelmed with the feeling of splendor and majesty. On either side of this gate, two elephants carved out of huge stone blocks are seen blowing bugles, which was built by Maharaja Rao Ratan Singh of Bundi. 'Hathi Pol' as the entrance gate of the Garh Palace is a symbol of special attraction not only for the Garh but for the visitors and tourists of the entire Bundi city.</p>
