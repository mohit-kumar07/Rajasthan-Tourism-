There are about 25,000 black rats here, which are called 'Kaba'. Their sanctity is evident from the fact that if a rat dies after being crushed by someone's feet, then a silver rat has to be made and offered at the feet of Karni Mata. According to a legend, Karni Mata's stepson Lakshmana died by drowning in a pond. Karni Mata prayed to Yamraj to bring her back to life. Yamraj refused and then agreed on the condition that from that day onwards all the descendants of Lakshman and Karni Mata would live in the form of rats. Considering thousands of rats as sacred, devotees offer laddus and large plates of milk in the temple, which the rats eat and drink. </p>
